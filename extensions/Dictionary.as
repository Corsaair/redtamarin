/**
 * The Dictionary class lets you create a dynamic collection of properties, which uses strict equality

 * identity is used to look up the object, and not the value returned from calling <code>toString()</code> on it.
 * <p>The following statements show the relationship between a Dictionary object and a key object:</p>
 * <pre>
 * var dict = new Dictionary();
 * var obj = new Object();
 * var key:Object = new Object();
 * key.toString = function() { return "key" }
 *
 * dict[key] = "Letters";
 * obj["key"] = "Letters";
 *
 * dict[key] == "Letters"; // true
 * obj["key"] == "Letters"; // true
 * obj[key] == "Letters"; // true because key == "key" is true b/c key.toString == "key"
 * dict["key"] == "Letters"; // false because "key" === key is false
 * delete dict[key]; //removes the key
