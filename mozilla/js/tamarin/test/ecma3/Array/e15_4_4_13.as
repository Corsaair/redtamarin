 *  Description:        Test Case for unshift function of Array Class.
 *			The arguments given to unshift are prepended to the start
 *			of the array, such that their order within the array is the
 *			same as the order in which they appear in the argument list.

 *  Date:               01/05/2006
 *  Details:            Added test cases to test the length of the unshift method, unshift    *                      without any parameters and to test that the unshift can be
 *                      transferred to other objects for use as method
