	 * The AtomConstants namespace defines constants for
	 * manipulating atoms.
	 *
	 * The atom is a primitive value in ActionScript.  Since
	 * ActionScript is a dynamically typed language, an atom can
	 * belong to one of several types: null, undefined, number,
	 * integer, string, boolean, object reference.
	 *
	 * Atoms are encoded with care to take up the minimum
	 * possible space.  An atom is represented by a 32-bit
	 * integer, with the bottom 3 bits indicating the type.
	 *
	 *		32 bit atom

	 *  000  - untagged
	 *  001  object
	 *  010  string
	 *  011  namespace
	 *  100  undefined
	 *  101  boolean
	 *  110  integer
	 *  111  double
	 *
	 *  - using last 3 bits means allocations must be 8-byte aligned.
	 *  - related types are 1 bit apart, e.g. int/double
	 *
	 *  kInteger atoms are used to represent integer values from -2^28..2^28-1,
	 *  regardless of whether the context implies int, uint, or Number.
	 *  If a number doesn't fit into that range it is stored as a kDoubleType
