	/**
	 * The CallStackNode class tracks the call stack of executing
	 * ActionScript code.  It is used for debugger stack dumps
	 * and also to keep track of the security contexts of
	 * running code.  There is a master CallStackNode object on
	 * AvmCore, which is maintained by MethodInfo::enter as
	 * methods enter and exit.
	 *
	 * A single CallStackNode object represents a level of the
	 * call stack.  It tracks the currently executing method,
	 * and the source file and line number if debug info
	 * is available.
	 *
	 * CallStackNode objects get strung together into linked
	 * lists to represent a full call stack.  Entering a
	 * method adds a new element to core->stackTrace's
	 * linked list; exiting a method removes it.
	 *
	 * As OP_debugfile and OP_debugline opcodes are encountered,
	 * the file and line number information in the current
	 * CallStackNode object is updated.
	 *
	 * CallStackNode objects are "semi-immutable."  The file
	 * and line number information can be updated until someone
	 * wants to snapshot the CallStackNode.  To snapshot, the
	 * "freeze" method is called.  This freezes the entire
	 * linked list.  Once a CallStackNode is frozen, it cannot
	 * be directly modified... a clone must be made of it,
	 * and then the clone can be modified.
	 *
	 * The "semi-immutable" aspect is to support AVM+ heap
	 * profiling.  Every ScriptObject will point to the
	 * CallStackNode at time of allocation, so that the developer
	 * can figure out the call stack where an object was
	 * created.  The semi-immutability makes it possible to
	 * conserve memory, by having many ScriptObjects point to
	 * the same CallStackNode chain, or chains containing common
	 * CallStackNode elements.
