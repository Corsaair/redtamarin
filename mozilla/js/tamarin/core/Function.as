			representation has the syntax of a FunctionDeclaration. Note in particular 
			that the use and placement of white space, line terminators, and semicolons 
			within the representation string is implementation-dependent.
			The toString function is not generic; it throws a TypeError exception if its this value is not a Function object.
			Therefore, it cannot be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.
