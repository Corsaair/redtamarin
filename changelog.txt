* 0.4.1 Akihabara (tag 1T180)
- added "patch" to versioning
  version.major=0
  version.minor=4
  version.patch=1
  version.serie=1
  version.cycle=T
  version.build=180
  see https://github.com/Corsaair/redtamarin/wiki/RedtamarinVersion

  we changed the format of the description
  from: redtamarin-0.4-beta[1T180]
    to: redtamarin-0.4.1.1T180-beta
  Runtime.description = redtamarin-0.4.1.1T180-beta

  Runtime.redtamarin = 0.4.1S131
  replaced by
  Runtime.version = 0.4.1.1T180
  but version is an Object
  so you can also access
  Runtime.version.major = 0
  Runtime.version.minor = 4
  Runtime.version.patch = 1
  Runtime.version.serie = 1
  Runtime.version.cycle = T
  Runtime.version.build = 180

  replaced by
  Runtime.AVMversion = 2.1 cyclone

  new properties
  Runtime.tag = 1T180

* 0.4.0 Akihabara (from tag 1T174)
- release

* 0.4.0 Akihabara (from tag 1T000)
- now we include ErrorConstant.as
  to be able to throw native errors from AS3
- lots of update to clean up documentation with asdoc
- added VMPI_GetEnviron
- implemented FileSystem class AS3 and native
- started to implement flash.filesystem and flash.net package
  not finished
- added undocumented class flash.system.SecurityPrivilege
- implemented C.sys.socket
- implemented C.sys.select
- implemented C.arpa.inet
- updated C.netdb, and others socket related API
- sockets and select are working for OS X
- sockets and select are working for Linux
- updated Windows native API so now socket and file descriptor
  can be inerchangeable which then allow to use close() on sockets
- updated Windows API so socket functions automatically initialize winsock
- updated exit() function to automatically cleanup winsock
  note: even without explictly calling exit() winsock will be cleaned up
  at condition the exit is normal, for abnormal exit winsock will be untouched
- sockets and select are working for Windows

* 0.4.0 Akihabara (from tag 1S540)
- added C.dirent basic closedir, opendir, readdir
- added more dirent: dirfd, fdopendir, rewinddir, seekdir, telldir
- added in fcntl: creat and open
- MAC OS X does not have fdopendir so we implmented it
- added non-standard function getdirentries() impl. in AS3
- refactor on fcntl, now asdoc indicate when options are compatible
  for POSIX(mac/linux), WIN (Windows only, MAC (Macintosh only), and NIX (Linux only)
- in fcntl, added openat() and fcntl() for POSIX (mac/linux)
- in asdoc added WIN, MAC, NIX and POSIX as "Runtime Versions" target
  how to use:
  @langversion 3.0
  @playerversion AVM 0.4
  @playerversion POSIX +
- oh and from now on we doublecheck our POSIX compatibility with gnulib
  we an not compile with gnulib but at least we can correct few things
  this and there
- changed source and sdk path to use "macintosh" and not "darwin" or "osx"
- added new folder "extras"
- added extra for DocBlockr package used with Sublime Text
- reimplemented fully errno.h, now we support all constants for all OS
- fully implemented limits.h, with support/compat for all OS
- added the option to generate fat swc for redtamarin.swc
- update includes and sync for Linux
- fixed windows build
- update includes and sync for windows
- compile under Windows but some implementations are missing
  eg. some POSIX function will return -1 and set errno = ENOSYS
- fixed redtamarin description for Windows
  cygwin will not accept '--enable-desc=redtamarin-0.0-unknown[0A000]'
  and display "AVMPLUS_DESC is not supported on windows via cygwin make.  Ignoring description."
  so we also generate an include on the fly 'src/as3/shell/description.incl'
  fixed: Runtime.description, Runtime.redtamarin
- Windows fix: stat, now we have correct file size, date stamp etc.
- Windows fix: the basic event loop (alpha quality) is working,
  yep Windows can goAsync() too
- Windows implement: HardwareInformation.memory,
  HardwareInformation.memoryUsage, HardwareInformation.memoryPeakUsage
- Windows implement for C.sys.stat:
  chmod(), mkdir(), stat() now supports UTF-8

- Windows implement for C.stdio:
  perror(), popen(), remove(), rename() now supports UTF-8
- Windows implement for C.unistd:
  access(), chdir(), getcwd(), getlogin(), rmdir(), unlink() now supports UTF-8
  note: not gethostname() because GetHostNameW is min supported by WIN8+
- Windows implement for C.string:
  strchr(), strdup(), strerror(), strlen(), strncpy(), etc. now supports UTF-8
- Windows note: execv(), execve(), execvp() do not now supports UTF-8 yet
- stabilize macintosh build, some fixes and bolts
- removed FileIO class

- integrate asc2.jar from FlasCC 1.0 (not in repo)
- reuse $AVMSHELL_EXE (ant var) in $AVM and $AVMSHELL_TOOL (env vars)
  which can be either avmshell-release, avmshell-debug, avmshell-debug-debugger
- cleanup shell_toplevel.as
  removed all extraneous tests, ns, metadata
  removed all avmplus package (AbstractBase, NativeBase, CheckBase, etc.)
  removed all test library code for API versioning
- cleanup SystemClass.h and SystemClass.cpp to be in sync with as3 class
- cleanup ShellCore.cpp, removed VMCFG_VERIFYALL and config.verifyonly check
  for NativeBaseClass, ShellCoreFriend1Class, ShellCoreFriend2Class, etc.
- moved flash.errors.* classes to flash_errors_classes.as and updated builtin scripts
- now we integrate avmglue in shell_toplevel.py
  tested with flash.errors.* package
- manifest.mk now have VMPI extensions (eg. all the *2.h files)
- manifest.mk now includes appi/clib and api/shell

  under OSX 10.8 ‘Gestalt’ is deprecated and there is no replacement
  for now we return 0.0.0
  need to do a new implementation later
- reimplemented clib
  errno.as/CErrnoClass.h/CErrnoClass.cpp
    removed get/set errno
    replaced by an ErrorNumber class and an errno const
  stdlib.as/StdlibClass.h/StdlibClass.cpp
    updated StdlibClass::exit to support workers
  unistd.as/UnistdClass.h/UnistdClass.cpp
    updated UnistdClass::sleep to reuse vmthread
- moved all avmplus/shell/avmglue AS3 classes in the /src/as3/ directory
- updated exactgc.py with the correct paths
  before:
  gen(prefix = 'avmshell', inputfiles = 'shell_toplevel.as DebugCLI.h ShellCore.h SystemClass.h', outputdir = outdir, srcdir = shelldir, ns = 'avmshell')
  gen(prefix = 'extensions', inputfiles = 'DomainClass.h Domain.as ../extensions/*.h ../extensions/*.as', outputdir = outdir, srcdir = shelldir, ns = 'avmplus')
  after:
  gen(prefix = 'avmshell', inputfiles = '../as3/avmplus/System.as DebugCLI.h ShellCore.h SystemClass.h', outputdir = outdir, srcdir = shelldir, ns = 'avmshell')
  gen(prefix = 'extensions', inputfiles = 'DomainClass.h ../as3/avmplus/Domain.as ../extensions/*.h ../extensions/*.as', outputdir = outdir, srcdir = shelldir, ns = 'avmplus')
- for API versioning ALWAYS include /src/core/api-versions.as
  when generating documentation from asdoc
  but in builtin.py never include /src/core/api-versions.as
  as we include it by default
- added public method getShellClasses() to ShellCore
  to easily get the shell_toplevel ClassManifest
- clean redtamarin logo for asdoc
- now build a redtamarin.abc (that merge builtin.abc and shell_toplevel.abc)
  see src/ for redtamarin.py
- both components redtamarin.swc and redtamarin.abc reuse the same
  redtamarin.as file from src/
- shell_toplevel.py use the same redtamarin.as than redtamarin.py
     */
    public const AAAAA:int = __errno.AAAAA;
- forced to update the way we deal with versioning
  only builtins can use CONFIG::AIR_1_0 etc.
  when you are defining avmglue API you need to use AVMGLUE::AIR_1_0
  also when you compile shell_toplevel.py and redtamarin.py
  you will need to define '-config AVMGLUE::REDTAMARIN=true'
  to create the namespace
- documented avm2.intrinsics.memory and integrated in asdoc
  if it keeps going like that our doc will be better than Adobe
- and tons more stuff

  return flase in very special cases
  (eg. a very old version of Windows who could not initialize winsock for ex)
