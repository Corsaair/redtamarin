redtamarin
==========

THIS PROJECT IS HOSTED ON GOOGLE CODE AND IS MIRRORED ON GITHUB
http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/

Simply put, redtamarin is based on the Tamarin project
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/ (eg. the Flash Player Virtual Machine)
and allow to run AS3 code on the command-line.

But because Tamarin only support the AS3 builtins (Object, Array, etc.),
redtamarin add numerous native functionalities, so you can test if your program
run under Windows or Linux, or read/write files, or send data with sockets, etc.

Put another way, if Adobe AIR allow you to build desktop executable with a GUI,
redtamarin allow you to build desktop executable with a CLI.


Mission Statement
-----------------

To support the use of the AS3 language for cross-platform command-line executable,
as single exe either for the desktop or the server, as scripts for automation,
as tools for the Flash Platform community.
