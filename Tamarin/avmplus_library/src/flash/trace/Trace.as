		 *     function foo(file_name:String, linenum:int, method_name:String, method_args:String):void
		 *
		 *  Depending upon the setting of the trace level, 2 or more arguments may be non-empty.  
		 *  In all cases file_name and method_name are obtained and passed to the callback.  If 
		 *  the trace level include line numbers information then this value is also obtained 
		 *  and passed into the callback.  Setting the trace level to include method arguments implies
		 *  that the 'method_args' parameter will be filled with string representation of the arguments
		 *  passed into the call.
