Those in the global script represent basic functionality with the IR not in SSA. This is because we can't prove anything at the global variable level.

The tests in the function directory are the same as those in the global script directory, just within a function. At the function level, we can start binding things to the function object.

Known bugs with sunspider tests:
s3d-raytrace - Implement double NaN
untyped/string-fasta - Implement hasnext2 opcode. Array iteration
