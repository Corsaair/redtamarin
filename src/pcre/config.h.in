/* On Unix-like systems config.h.in is converted by "configure" into config.h.
Some other environments also support the use of "configure". PCRE is written in
Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope with, allowing
it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.

If you are going to build PCRE "by hand" on a system without "configure" you
should copy the distributed config.h.generic to config.h, and then set up the
macros the way you need them. Alternatively, you can avoid editing by using -D
on the compiler command line to set the macro values.

PCRE uses memmove() if HAVE_MEMMOVE is set to 1; otherwise it uses bcopy() if
HAVE_BCOPY is set to 1. If your system has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), set
them both to 0; an emulation function will be used. */

   "configure", this can be done via --enable-ebcdic. */
