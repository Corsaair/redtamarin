ABCDIS is an abc dissasembler contributed by Chris Brichford.
Also see bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=640986

abcdis is meant as a replacement for abcdump with cleaned up output.

abcdisclassic mimics abcdump's output style.

Since these were contributed, abcdump has evolved slightly.  Once
abcdis is caught up and vetted, we should remove abcdump.

to compile:
1. set $ASC
2. make curdir=. -f manifest.mk utils
