Run-time compiler for ActionScript 3 - some usage and implementation notes.
2011-07-07 / lhansen@adobe.com


Note, this list may be out of date now, see notes about what works and doesn't
at the end of backlog.txt.


= AS3 support =

AS3 extensions supported so far (also see notes below):

- Rest arguments
- Type annotations
- "namespace" definitions
- "include" directive
- unqualified "import" directive (ie, 'import foo.*')
- operators "is", "as", "to"
- E4X
- classes, interfaces, "super" statement and built-in namespaces 
  except "protected" are mostly supported


= 'include' directives =

The 'include' directive is allowed if the script containing the
'include' originates from a file; if not, a SyntaxError is thrown.

The resolution of the file name in the directive is delegated to the
implementer of the AvmCore instance.  In the avmshell the name is
resolved relative to the file name of the script contining the
directive.

Recursive includes are allowed, currently to unlimited depth without
checking for cycles, as names are not canonicalized.  It is easy to
place a depth limit in the parser.


= Changes to the language relative to ASC =

- 'use namespace' and 'import' are allowed even as the substatements
  of 'if' etc, not just on the top level of blocks.  Seems silly to
  prohibit the former use when it's allowed for 'var' and 'const'.

- We aim not to early-bind to any global names, unlike ASC, except
  names with predefined meaning (""::Object, etc) in contexts where
  they are used to implement language semantics (and even there it
  may not matter due to how loading works).  ASC has different
  behavior for "var x:T = new T()" if there is more than one T
  visible: it early-binds to the first in standard mode and to both
  in strict mode.  The standard-mode behavior is likely a bug.

	It is not only incomplete but also outdated. It represents the language

= Instruction set and/or verifier bugs =

* The object that's created with NEWACTIVATION must not be coerced to atom before
  being pushed, or local variable lookup stops functioning.  To see this, just
  introduce COERCE_A just before pushscope when pushing the activation object
  in the function prologue and when restoring the scope stack in an exception handler.

* The same is true for the object that is created with NEWCATCH.  In this case it
  introduces a bigger problem, which is that the local that holds a reference to
  the catch object (so that the scope stack can be restored) now is known by the
  verifier to be of a certain type, which is irreconcilable with the type that
  that local has on any exit from the catch body.  Since we can't coerce the value
  (there is no coerce-to-catch-object instruction) the local must be killed on every
  exit, which introduces complexity into the code generator: insert kills before the
  jump when handling unstructured control flow.  I don't know how general that hack is.

* The requirement that the second operand to HASNEXT2 must have an integer value
  causes the same complications as NEWCATCH, though they can be worked around
  because the instruction set has an instruction to coerce to int.  See comments
  before ForInStmt::cogen.
