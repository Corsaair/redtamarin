# For the moment, pretend that nothing but mac exists, and we can always
# use gcc automatic dependencies.

# A "thing" is any static library, DLL, or program.
# things are made up of CXXSRCS and CSRCS.
#
# By default, we use CPPFLAGS/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS.
# This can be overridden using thingname_CPPFLAGS
#
# If you want to *add* flags (without overriding the defaults), use
# thingname_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS
#
# the default target is "all::". Individual manifest.mk should add
# all:: dependencies for any object that should be made by default.

# STATIC_LIBRARIES:
# By default, the library base name is the thingname. To override, set
# thingname_BASENAME
