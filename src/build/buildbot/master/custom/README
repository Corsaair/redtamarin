The buildbot directory defines customized buildbot source files that have been modified for
use in the tamarin buildbot.  In order for these files to override the original buildbot source
the following environment variable MUST be defined:

export PYTHONPATH="path/to/custom/buildbot_dir;$PYTHONPATH"

This will force python to search through these custom directories before loading the 
original buildbot source in site-packages.
