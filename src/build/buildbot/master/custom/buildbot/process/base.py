    either None or a tuple of (patchlevel, diff), consisting of a number to
    use in 'patch -pN', and a unified-format context diff.

    Alternatively, the SourceStamp may specify a set of Changes to be built,
    contained in source.changes. In this case, I may be mergeable with other
    BuildRequests on the same branch.

    I may be part of a BuildSet, in which case I will report status results
    to it.

    information.
