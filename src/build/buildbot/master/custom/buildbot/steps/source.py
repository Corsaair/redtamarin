        @type  workdir: string
        @param workdir: local directory (relative to the Builder's root)
                        where the tree should be placed

        @type  mode: string
        @param mode: the kind of VC operation that is desired:
           - 'update': specifies that the checkout/update should be
             performed directly into the workdir. Each build is performed
             in the same directory, allowing for incremental builds. This
             minimizes disk space, bandwidth, and CPU time. However, it
             may encounter problems if the build process does not handle
             dependencies properly (if you must sometimes do a 'clean
             build' to make sure everything gets compiled), or if source
             files are deleted but generated files can influence test
             behavior (e.g. python's .pyc files), or when source
             directories are deleted but generated files prevent CVS from
             removing them.

           - 'copy': specifies that the source-controlled workspace
             should be maintained in a separate directory (called the
             'copydir'), using checkout or update as necessary. For each
             build, a new workdir is created with a copy of the source
             tree (rm -rf workdir; cp -R -P -p copydir workdir). This
             doubles the disk space required, but keeps the bandwidth low
             (update instead of a full checkout). A full 'clean' build
             is performed each time.  This avoids any generated-file
             build problems, but is still occasionally vulnerable to
             problems such as a CVS repository being manually rearranged
             (causing CVS errors on update) which are not an issue with
             a full checkout.

           - 'clobber': specifies that the working directory should be
             deleted each time, necessitating a full checkout for each
             build. This insures a clean build off a complete checkout,
             avoiding any of the problems described above, but is
             bandwidth intensive, as the whole source tree must be
             pulled down for each build.

           - 'export': is like 'clobber', except that e.g. the 'cvs
             export' command is used to create the working directory.
             This command removes all VC metadata files (the
             CVS/.svn/{arch} directories) from the tree, which is
             sometimes useful for creating source tarballs (to avoid
             including the metadata in the tar file). Not all VC systems
             support export.

        @type  alwaysUseLatest: boolean
        @param alwaysUseLatest: whether to always update to the most
        recent available sources for this build.

        Normally the Source step asks its Build for a list of all
        Changes that are supposed to go into the build, then computes a
        'source stamp' (revision number or timestamp) that will cause
        exactly that set of changes to be present in the checked out
        tree. This is turned into, e.g., 'cvs update -D timestamp', or
        'svn update -r revnum'. If alwaysUseLatest=True, bypass this
        computation and always update to the latest available sources
        for each build.

        The source stamp helps avoid a race condition in which someone
        commits a change after the master has decided to start a build
        but before the slave finishes checking out the sources. At best
        this results in a build which contains more changes than the
        buildmaster thinks it has (possibly resulting in the wrong
        person taking the blame for any problems that result), at worst
        is can result in an incoherent set of sources (splitting a
        non-atomic commit) which may not build at all.

        @type  retry: tuple of ints (delay, repeats) (or None)
        @param retry: if provided, VC update failures are re-attempted up
                      to REPEATS times, with DELAY seconds between each
                      attempt. Some users have slaves with poor connectivity
                      to their VC repository, and they say that up to 80% of
                      their build failures are due to transient network
                      failures that could be handled by simply retrying a
                      couple times.
