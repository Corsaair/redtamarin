(Preliminary, will be updated.)

These results were obtained on lhansen's MacBook Pro.  The format is
CSV and machine-readable, please keep it that way.  Result recorded is
best (highest) of three runs, reloaded in the same tab.  Significant
variability were seen in some runs, see notes.

Other notes:

Opera 10.10 is a bytecode interpreter; the JIT in 10.50 is not yet
available on Mac.

The funcall-1 benchmark needs to be rewritten, currently it's a loop
calling an empty function, and obtaining a new Date object for each
iteration.  The latter probably dominates.  It was written that way
because of Tamarin's slow integer arithmetic.
