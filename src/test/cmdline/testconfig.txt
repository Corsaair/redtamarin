# testconfig.txt syntax
# this file allows failures to be marked as known
# specify a bug in the notes field for tracking of failures
# name - is a regular expression to match one or more test names
# type - is expectedfailure or skip
#        expectedfailure is preferable and will verify the test fails, if the test passes but is marked
#             as expectedfailure the result will be unexpectedfailure
#        skip will ignore whether the test passes or failed, this is used for intermittent problems
#             where the test does not reliably pass
# name, type [skip], notes
