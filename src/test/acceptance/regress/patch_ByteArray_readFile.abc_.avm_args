# patch_ByteArray_readFile.abc_ hacks the ByteArray prototype to add the now-removed method "readFile",
# used by a few fuzzed files we'd rather not have to re-create. This file just calls "printpassed"
# after we execute patch_ByteArray_readFile.abc_, to pacify the testing machinery. 
# See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=564248 for more info.
