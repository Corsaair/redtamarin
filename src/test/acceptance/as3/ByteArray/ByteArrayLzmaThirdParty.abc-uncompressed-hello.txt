Hello World!

More text; Felix wants to illustrate content that is compressed by
LZMA, but a 13 byte file with just "Hello World!\n" is compressed to a
31 byte file by LZMA.  (Though perhaps a large portion is LZMA header?
Not sure yet.)  Easy ending: LZMA LZMA LZMA Hello World LZMA LZMA LZMA
LZMA LZMA LZMA Hello World LZMA LZMA LZMA Malkovich Malkovich LZMA
LZMA LZMA Malkovich LZMA LZMA LZMA LZMA.
