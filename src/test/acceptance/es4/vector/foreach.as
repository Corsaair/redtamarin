   File Name:    foreach.es
   Description:  foreach(object,eacher,thisobj)
     calls checker on every vector element of object in increasing numerical index order,
     collecting all the vector elements for which checker returns a value.
     checker is called with three arguments, the property value, the property index, the object itself.
     the thisobj is used as the this object in the call.
     returns a new vector object containing the elements that were collected in the order they were
     collected.
