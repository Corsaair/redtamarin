"""Easy to use object-oriented thread pool framework.

A thread pool is a class that maintains a pool of worker threads to perform
time consuming operations in parallel. It assigns jobs to the threads
by putting them in a work request queue, where they are picked up by the
next available thread. This then performs the requested operation in the
background and puts the results in a another queue.

The thread pool class can then collect the results from all threads from
this queue as soon as they become available or after all threads have
finished their work. It's also possible, to define callbacks to handle
each result as it comes in.

The basic concept and some code was taken from the book "Python in a Nutshell"
by Alex Martelli, copyright 2003, ISBN 0-596-00188-6, from section 14.5
"Threaded Program Architecture". I wrapped the main program logic in the
ThreadPool class, added the WorkRequest class and the callback system and
tweaked the code here and there.

Basic usage:

>>> main = TreadPool(poolsize)
>>> requests = makeRequests(some_callable, list_of_args, callback)
>>> [main.putRequests(req) for req in requests]
>>> main.wait()

See the end of the module code for a brief, annotated usage example.
