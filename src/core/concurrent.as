/**
 * The Mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") class provides a way to make sure 
 * that only one set of code operates on a particular block of memory or other 
 * shared resource at a time. The primary use for a Mutex is to manage code in 
 * different workers accessing a shareable byte array (a ByteArray object whose 
 * <code>shareable</code> property is <code>true</code>). However, a Mutex can be 
 * used to manage workers' access to any shareable resource, such as an AIR native 
 * extension or a filesystem file. No matter what the resource, the purpose of 
 * the mutex is to ensure that only one set of code accesses the resource at a time.
 *
 * <p>A mutex manages access using the concept of resource ownership. At any 
 * time a single mutex is "owned" by at most one worker. When ownership of a 
 * mutex switches from one worker to another the transision is atomic. This 
 * guarantees that it will never be possible for more than one worker to take 
 * ownership of the mutex. As long as code in a worker only operates on a shared 
 * resource when that worker owns the mutex, you can be certain that there will 
 * never be a conflict from multiple workers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Use the <code>tryLock()</code> method to take ownership of the mutex if 
 * it is available. Use the <code>lock()</code> method to pause the current 
 * worker's execution until the mutex is available, then take ownership of the 
 * mutex. Once the current worker has ownership of the mutex, it can safely 
 * operate on the shared resource. When those operations are complete, call the 
 * <code>unlock()</code> method to release the mutex. At that point the current 
 * worker should no longer access the shared resource.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Mutex class is one of the special object types that are shared 
 * between workers rather than copied between them. When you pass a mutex from 
 * one worker to another worker either by calling the Worker object's 
 * <code>setSharedProperty()</code> method or by using a MessageChannel object, 
 * both workers have a reference to the same Mutex object in the runtime's memory.</p>

/**
 * A Condition object is a tool for sharing a resource between workers with the 
 * additional capability of pausing execution until a particular condition is 
 * satisfied. A Condition object is used in conjunction with a Mutex object, and 
 * adds additional functionality to the mutex's behavior. By working in 
 * combination with a mutex, the runtime ensures that each transition of 
 * ownership between workers is atomic.
 * 
 * <p>The following is one possible workflow for using a Condition object:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Before using a Condition object, the first worker must take ownership 
 *       of the condition's associated mutex by calling the Mutex object's 
 *       <code>lock()</code> or <code>tryLock()</code> methods.</li>
 *   <li>The worker's code operates on the shared resource until some condition 
 *       becomes false, preventing the worker from doing more work with the 
 *       shared resource. For example, if the shared resource is a set of data 
 *       to process, when there is no more data to process the worker can't 
 *       do any more work.</li>
 *   <li>At that point, call the Condition object's <code>wait()</code> method 
 *       to pause the worker's execution and release ownership of the mutex.</li>
 *   <li>At some point, a second worker takes ownership of the mutex. Because 
 *       the mutex is available, it is safe for the second worker's code to 
 *       operate on the shared resource. The second worker does whatever is 
 *       necessary to satisfy the condition so that the first worker can do its 
 *       work again. For example, if the first worker has no data to process, 
 *       the second worker could pass more data to process into the shared resource.</li>
 *   <li>At that point, the condition related to the first worker's work is now 
 *       true, so the first worker needs to be notified that the condition is 
 *       fulfilled. To notify the first worker, the second worker's code calls 
 *       the Condition object's <code>notify()</code> method or its 
 *       <code>notifyAll()</code> method.</li>
 *   <li>In addition to calling <code>notify()</code>, the second worker needs 
 *       to release ownership of the mutex. It does this either by calling the 
 *       Mutex object's <code>unlock()</code> method or the Condition object's 
 *       <code>wait()</code> method. Since the first worker called the 
 *       <code>wait()</code> method, ownership of the mutex returns to the 
 *       first worker. Code execution in the first worker then continues again 
 *       with the next line of code following the <code>wait()</code> call.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>The Condition class is one of the special object types that are shared 
 * between workers rather than copied between them. When you pass a condition 
 * from one worker to another worker either by calling the Worker object's 
 * <code>setSharedProperty()</code> method or by using a MessageChannel object,
