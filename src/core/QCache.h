/*
	QCache is a simple framework for maintaining a cache of items, with a random
	eviction policy. The cache is limited by count of items, which can be set arbitrarily
	(or allowed to grow to unlimited size).
	
	The recommended use case is to split a a data structure split into a small, frequently-used
	chunk (owner), and a larger, less-frequently-used chunk (cacheditem) that can be reconstituted
	from compressed data; e.g., the slot-binding tables for Traits, which are kept in memory in 
	a highly compressed	form (the ABC bytecode), and expanded into convenient hashtable format
	as a cacheditem.
	
	Important note: For proper use, the only "strong" ref to the cacheditem should be via
	the QCache itself; the owner should keep a reference to the cacheditem via a GCWeakRef, which
	will allow the cacheditem to be collected when it is evicted from the cache. (Naturally, the owner
	must check the GCWeakRef for null before using it.)
	
	Cached items are stored in a singly-linked list; it's assumed that the cost
	of building a new item to add to the cache is likely to dwarf the cost of walking
	the list to evict an item (this is currently the case for all existing use cases).
