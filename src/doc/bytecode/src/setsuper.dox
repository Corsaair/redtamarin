\subsection description Description

value is the value that the property will be set to. value is popped off the stack and saved.

index is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. If the 
multiname at that index is a runtime multiname the name and/or namespace will 
also appear on the stack so that the multiname can be constructed correctly at runtime.

Once the multiname is constructed the base class of obj is determined and the 
multiname is resolved in the declared traits of the base class. The property is 
then set to value. See “Resolving multinames” on page 10.

\subsection rt_execeptions Runtime exceptions

A TypeError is thrown if obj is null or undefined. 

A ReferenceError is thrown if the property is unresolved, or if the property is read-only.

\subsection notes Notes

None.
