\subsection description Description

index is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. If the multiname at 
that index is a runtime multiname the name and/or namespace will also appear on the stack so 
that the multiname can be constructed correctly at runtime

Once the multiname is constructed, the base class of obj is determined and the multiname is 
resolved in the declared traits of the base class. The value of the resolved property is 
pushed onto the stack. See “Resolving multinames” on page 10.

\subsection rt_execeptions Runtime exceptions

A TypeError is thrown if obj is null or undefined. 

A ReferenceError is thrown if the property is unresolved, or if the property is write-only.

\subsection notes Notes

None.
