\subsection description Description

offset is an s24 that is the number of bytes to jump if value1 is greater than or equal to value2.

Compute value2 < value1 using the abstract relational comparison algorithm in ECMA-262 
section 11.8.5. If the result of the comparison is true, jump the number of bytes indicated 
by offset. Otherwise continue executing code from this point.
