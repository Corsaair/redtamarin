\subsection description Description

index is a u30 that must be an index into the multiname constant pool. The multiname at index 
must not be a runtime multiname.

The type specified by the multiname is resolved, and value is coerced to that type. The 
resulting value is pushed onto the stack. If any of valueâ€™s base classes, or implemented
interfaces matches the type specified by the multiname, then the conversion succeeds and 
the result is pushed onto the stack.

\subsection rt_execeptions Runtime exceptions

A TypeError is thrown if value cannot be coerced to the specified type.

\subsection notes Notes

None.
