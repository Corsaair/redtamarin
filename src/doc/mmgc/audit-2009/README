I undertook an audit of mmgc in the spring of 2009 to assess its
suitability for embedded and mobile systems.  One product of this
audit has been the documents in the present directory, which
constitute the most complete design documents for MMgc to date.  As
design documents they are still incomplete, and they need to evolve
with MMgc, but those digging into MMgc may find them useful.

The source for the documents uses a wiki syntax, which is processed to
HTML by the script /utils/stitch.py.  The PDF files in the present
directory are the result of loading the HTML into firefox and printing
the document as a PDF file.
