This directory contains code for an ES4 compiler written in ES4.  The
compiler generates code for Tamarin (.abc format).


STATE OF THE SYSTEM

The code is pretty much in pre-alpha state.  ESC supports all of ES3
(modulo some known bugs) and quite a bit of proposed ES4, with more
features being added continually.  It can rebuild itself, has OK
performance, and generates OK code.

At this time (April 2008) the main focus is on extending ESC to track
the ES4 spec as that spec is being developed.


PRELIMINARIES

You need to compile tamarin-central (a Release_Debugger build is best)
and install the resulting executable as esc/bin/shell.exe.


RUNNING

A set of last known good .abc files is provided in the ./bin directory
so you can run the compiler out of the box.  

There is a command-line compiler:

  cd build
  ./esc.sh <filename>.es    // produces <filename>.es.abc

There is a read-eval-print loop:

  cd build
  ./main.sh

Due to Tamarin artifacts that have yet to be fixed the global object
has peculiarities that will trip you up.  Global variables created by
assigning to undefined names are not visible to later expressions
entered at the repl, for example.

There are various decompilation and debugging tools that need to be
documented here.



BUILDING

There is a makefile that builds the compiler.

  cd build
  make

(or "make all", "make clean", and so on -- UTSL).


BUGS

Known bugs are logged in the Tamarin/ESC component in Bugzilla.
