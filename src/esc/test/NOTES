./run-sanity uses ESC on Tamarin to execute a set of test cases
and compares the resulting asts and logs against the last best
output.

To add a test, put the test file in ./sanity/tests and the 
expected .ast and .log in ./sanity/regress, and add to the
file run-sanity.sh a line to run the new test.
