Run all the tests by running "run.sh".

Add a test by adding a .es file in an appropriate subdirectory and
adding a .es.key file in the same directory, providing the expected
output.

All files should use Unix line endings; use dos2unix.

Remove log files and abc files by running "clean.sh".

DO NOT COMMIT LOG FILES OR ABC FILES!
